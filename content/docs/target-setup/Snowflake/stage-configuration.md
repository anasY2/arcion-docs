# Stage configuration

By default, Replicant uses Snowflakeâ€™s native stage for bulk loading. But it's possible to use an external stage like Azure to hold the data files and then load them on the target Snowflake server from there. The `stage` section of [the connection configuration file]({{< ref "setup-guide#i-set-up-connection-configuration" >}}) allows you to specify the details Replicant needs to connect to and use a specific stage.

The following parameters are available for configuring stages. For example configuration for each stage, see [Examples](#examples).

### `type`*[v21.06.14.1]*
The stage type. The following stages are allowed:

- **`NATIVE`**. Use Snowflake's native stage. 
- **`S3`**. Use Amazon S3 as the stage.
- **`AZURE`**. Use Microsoft Azure as the stage.
  
### `root-dir`
A directory on stage which can be used to stage bulk-load files.

### `conn-url`*[v21.06.14.1]* 
The URL for the stage. For example, if you're using Amazon S3 as stage, specify the bucket name. If you're using Microsoft Azure as stage, specify the container name.

### `key-id`
If you're using Amazon S3 as stage, this parameter holds [the access Key ID for your AWS account that's hosting S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-about).

### `account-name`*[v21.06.14.1]*
If you're using Microsoft Azure as the stage, this is the name of the ADLS storage account.

### `secret-key`*[v21.06.14.1]*
This parameter is for both `S3` and `AZURE` types. It represents Amazon S3 secret key and Azure storage secret key.

### `token`*[v21.06.14.1]*
If you're using Microsoft Azure as the stage, this parameter holds [the SAS token for Azure storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview#sas-token).

## Examples

### Microsoft Azure as stage

The following shows a sample stage configuration for Azure as stage:

```YAML
stage:
  type: AZURE
  root-dir: "replicate-stage/snowflake-stage"
  conn-url: "replicate-stage"
  account-name: "replicant-storageaccount"
  secret-key: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
  token: "YOUR_SAS_TOKEN"
```

Replace the following:
- *`YOUR_SECRET_KEY`*: your Azure storage secret key
- *`YOUR_SAS_TOKEN`*: your SAS token for Azure storage

### Amazon S3 as stage

The following shows a sample stage configuration for S3 as stage:

```YAML
stage:
  type: S3
  root-dir: "replicate-stage/snowflake-stage"  
  conn-url: "replicate-stage"
  key-id: "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID"   
  secret-key: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```

Replace the following:
- *`YOUR_SECRET_KEY`*: your S3 secret key
- *`YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID`*: the access key ID for your AWS account that's hosting S3
