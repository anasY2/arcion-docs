# Destination Microsoft SQL Server

The extracted `replicant-cli` will be referred to as the `$REPLICANT_HOME` directory in the following steps.

## I. Set up connection configuration
Specify the connection details of your SQL Server instance to Replicant with a connection configuration file. You can find a sample connection configuration file `sqlserver.yaml` in `$REPLICANT_HOME/conf/conn` directory. The following configuration parameters are available:

### `type`
The connection type representing the database. In this case, it's `SQLServer`.

### `host`
The hostname of your SQL Server system.

### `port`
The port number to connect to the `host`.

### `username`
The username credential to access the SQL Server system.

### `password`
The password associated with `username`.

### `max-connections` 
The maximum number of connections Replicant uses to load data into the SQL Server system.

{{< hint "info" >}}
#### For Arcion self-hosted
You can store your connection credentials in AWS Secrets Manager instead of putting them in plain form in the connection configuration file. In that case, you can tell Replicant to retrieve those credentials. For more information, see [Retrieve credentials from AWS Secrets Manager](/docs/references/secrets-manager).
{{< /hint >}}

The following is a sample connection configuration:

```YAML
type: SQLSERVER

host: 192.168.0.166 
port: 1433

username: 'replicate'
password: 'Replicate#123'

max-connections: 30
```

## II. Configure mapper file (optional)
If you want to define data mapping from source to your target SQL Server, specify the mapping rules in the mapper file. For more information on how to define the mapping rules and run Replicant CLI with the mapper file, see [Mapper Configuration]({{< ref "/docs/references/mapper-reference" >}}).

## III. Set up Applier configuration
To configure replication mode according to your requirements, specify your configuration in the Applier configuration file. You can find a sample Applier configuration file `sqlserver.yaml` in the `$REPLICANT_HOME/conf/dst` directory. 

Arcion Replicant supports the following Replicant modes for SQL Server as target:

- `snapshot`
- `full`
- `realtime`
- `delta-snapshot`

For more information about different Replicant modes, see [Running Replicant]({{< ref "running-replicant" >}}).

You can configure replication modes by specifying the parameters under their respective sections in the configuration file. See the following sections for more information.

### Configure `snapshot` mode
The following is a sample configuration for operating in `snapshot` mode:

```YAML
snapshot:
  threads: 32
  batch-size-rows: 10_000
  txn-size-rows: 1_000_000
```

#### Use bulk loading
If you want to use bulk loading in snapshot mode, use the `bulk-load` section to specify your configuration. For example:

```YAML
bulk-load:
  enable: true
  type: FILE
  bulk-file-location: \\192.168.0.199\Replicant
```

{{< hint "warning" >}}
**Important:** 
- If you enable bulk loading, make sure to specify the `bulk-file-location` parameter. This is s Samba URL. SQL Server (running on Windows on some network) uses this URL to access the files generated by Replicant running on the same network and ingest them. If you disable bulk loading by setting `enable` to `false`, giving any value to `bulk-file-location` will throw parsing error.
- Replicant only supports `FILE` type bulk loading.
{{< /hint >}}

For more information about the configuration parameters for snapshot mode, see [Snapshot Mode]({{< ref "/docs/references/applier-reference#snapshot-mode" >}}).

### Configure `realtime` mode
The following is a sample configuration for operating in `realtime` mode:

```YAML
realtime:
  threads: 8
  txn-size-rows: 10000
  batch-size-rows: 1000
```
For more information about the configuration parameters for `realtime` mode, see [Realtime Mode]({{< ref "/docs/references/applier-reference#realtime-mode" >}}).

## Support for recovery
Arcion Replicant makes use of the following strategies for recovery:

- `UPDATE_INSERT`
- `DELETE_INSERT`
- `SINGLE_DELETE_INSERT`

In order for recovery to work, you must run Replicant CLI with the `--replace` option. For more information, see [Running Replicant]({{< ref "running-replicant" >}}).
