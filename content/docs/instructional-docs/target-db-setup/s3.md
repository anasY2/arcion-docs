# Destination S3

The directory in which you have downloaded `replicant-cli` in will be referred to as the `$REPLICANT_HOME` directory in the proceeding steps.

## I. Setup Connection Configuration

1. From `$REPLICANT_HOME` navigate to the sample S3 connection configuration file
    ```BASH
    vi conf/conn/s3.yaml
    ```

2. Make the necessary changes as follows:
    ```YAML
    type: S3

    access-key: "REPLICANT" #Replace REPLICANT with the access key of AWS user created from IAM management
    secret-key: "Replicant#123" #Replace Replicant#123 with the secret Key of the AWS User (note: make sure the specified user has  AmazonS3FullAccess)

    bucket: "bucket_name" #Replace bucket_name with the name of your S3 bucket
    root: "root_dir" #Replace root_dir with the name of the directory inside the s3 bucket where the CSV files will be stored

    stage:
      type: SHARED_FS
      root-dir: /home/user/stage #Enter the path of the directory where CSV files will be staged before uploading to S3

    file-format: CSV #Possible file formats: CSV or JSON
    max-connections: 50 #Maximum number of connections Replicant can open in the target s3
    ```

## Setup Applier Configuration

1. From `$REPLICANT_HOME` navigate to the sample Snowflake applier configuration file
    ```BASH
    vi conf/dst/s3.yaml        
    ```

2. Make the necessary changes as follows:
    ```YAML
    snapshot:
      max-file-size: 33_554_432 #32MB
      delimiter: `,` #CSV files created will have provided delimiter
      quote: `‚Äù`
      escape:   `\`
      include-header: false #enable or disable toggle column names as header in CSV file
    ```

## III. S3 File Format

When data is being loaded into S3, the data is first converted to either a CSV or JSON file. Follow the link below to understand the data format for the CSV and JSON converted files.

[S3 File Format]({{< ref "/docs/reference-docs/s3-file-format" >}} "S3 File Format")


**Note**: It is highly recommended that you read the S3 file format page when using S3 as the target system.
