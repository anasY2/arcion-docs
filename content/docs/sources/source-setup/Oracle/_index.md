# Source Oracle

Arcion's Oracle connector can replicate data from your Oracle source database and load it into your destination.

Arcion supports traditional Oracle database, as well as Oracle pluggable database (PDB) for its multitenant container database (CDB) architecture.

Here you'll find [a comprehensive setup guide]({{< relref "setup-guide" >}}) that can quickly get you up and running. We also describe [how Arcion can make use of Oracle redo log files]({{< relref "native-oracle-log-reader" >}}), [support for Oracle ASM]({{< relref "native-oracle-log-reader#oracle-asm" >}}), and [Oracle's native Data Pump Export (expdp) utility]({{< relref "native-export" >}}).
