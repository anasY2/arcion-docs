# Oracle setup guide

Arcion's Oracle connector can replicate data from your Oracle source database and load it into your destination. We support both [traditional Oracle database](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/glossary.htm#GUID-B2710CAA-8F00-40B3-97AB-4521D2147EE8) and [Oracle pluggable database for multitenant architecture](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/glossary.htm#GUID-D6932E25-775E-4FF1-BB08-F8999629093C) as source.
