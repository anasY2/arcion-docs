Arcion will support hashing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) before saving it on destination. This enables customers to mask sensitive source information from leaking to other data sources. Replicant will also support encryption of columns using an encryption key provided by user.

Arcion will continue adding more features to fully provide protection for PII.
