# Source MySQL

The extracted `replicant-cli` will be referred to as the `$REPLICANT_HOME` directory.

## I. Install mysqlbinlog Utility on Replicate Host

1. Install a compatible mysqlbinlog utility (compatible with the source MySQL server) on the machine where replicate will be running
  * **Note**: The easiest way to install the correct mysqlbin log utility is to install the the the same MySQL server version as your source MySQL System. After installation, you can stop this MySQL server running on replicateâ€™s host using the command
    ```BASH
    sudo systemctl stop mysql
    ```

## II. Enable binary logging in MySQL server

1. Open the MySQL option file `var/lib/my.cnf` (create the file if it doesn't already exist). Add the following lines in the file:

    ```SHELL
    [mysqld]
    log-bin=mysql-log.bin
    binlog_format=ROW
    ```
    The first line [specifies the base name to use for binary log files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#option_mysqld_log-bin). The second line [sets the binary logging format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_format).

2. Export `$MYSQL_HOME` path with the following command:
    ```SQL
    export MYSQL_HOME=/var/lib/mysql
    ```
3. Restart MySQL with the following command:
  
    ```BASH
    sudo systemctl restart mysql
    ```
4. Verify if binlogging is turned on with the following command:
    ```BASH
    mysql -u root -p
    ```
    ```SQL
    mysql> show variables like "%log_bin%";
    +---------------------------------+--------------------------------+
    | Variable_name                   | Value                          |
    +---------------------------------+--------------------------------+
    | log_bin                         | ON                             |
    | log_bin_basename                | /var/lib/mysql/mysql-bin       |
    | log_bin_compress                | OFF                            |
    | log_bin_compress_min_len        | 256                            |
    | log_bin_index                   | /var/lib/mysql/mysql-bin.index |
    | log_bin_trust_function_creators | OFF                            |
    | sql_log_bin                     | ON                             |
    +---------------------------------+--------------------------------+
    7 rows in set (0.011 sec)
    ```

## III. Set up MySQL User for Replicant
1.	Create MySQL user
    ```SQL
    CREATE USER 'username'@'replicate_host' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    ```
2.	Grant below privileges on all tables involved in replication
    ```SQL
    GRANT SELECT ON "<user_database>"."<table_name>" TO 'username'@'replicate_host';
    ```
3.	Grant the following Replication privileges
    ```SQL
    GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'username'@'replicate_host';
    GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'username'@'replicate_host';
    ```
4.	Verify if created user can access bin logs
    ```SQL
    mysql> show binary logs;
    +------------------+-----------+
    | Log_name         | File_size |
    +------------------+-----------+
    | mysql-bin.000001 |       351 |
    | mysql-bin.000002 |      4635 |
    | mysql-bin.000003 |       628 |
    | mysql-bin.000004 | 195038185 |
    +------------------+-----------+
    4 rows in set (0.001 sec)
    ```

## IV. Set up Connection Configuration

1. From ```$REPLICANT_HOME```, navigate to the connection configuration file
    ```BASH
    vi conf/conn/mysql_src.yaml
    ```

2. If you store your connection credentials in AWS Secrets Manager, you can tell Replicant to retrieve them. For more information, see [Retrieve credentials from AWS Secrets Manager](/docs/references/secrets-manager). 
    
    Otherwise, you can put your credentials like usernames and passwords in plain form like the sample below:
    ```YAML
    type: MYSQL

    host: 127.0.0.1 #Replace 127.0.0.1 with your MySQL server host name
    port: 3306 #Replace the 3306 with the port of your host

    username: "replicant" #Replace replicant with your username of the user that connects to your MySQL server
    password: "Replicant#123" #Replace Replicant#123 with the your user's password

    slave-server-ids: [1]
    max-connections: 30 #Maximum number of connections replicant can open in MySQL
    ```

## V. Setup Filter Configuration

1. From ```$REPLICANT_HOME```, navigate to the filter configuration file
    ```BASH
    vi filter/mysql_filter.yaml
    ```

2. In accordance to you replication needs, specify the data which is to be replicated. Use the format of the example explained below.  

    ```yaml
    allow:
      #In this example, data of object type Table in the catalog tpch will be replicated
      catalog: "tpch"
      types: [TABLE]

      #From catalog tpch, only the NATION, ORDERS, and PART tables will be replicated.
      #Note: Unless specified, all tables in the catalog will be replicated
      allow:
        NATION:
           #Within NATION, only the US and AUS columns will be replicated
           allow: ["US, AUS"]

        ORDERS:  
           #Within ORDERS, only the product and service columns will be replicated as long as they meet the condition o_orderkey < 5000
           allow: ["product", "service"]
           conditions: "o_orderkey < 5000"

        PART: #All columns in the table PART will be replicated without any predicates
    ```

    The following is a template of the format you must follow:

    ```YAML
    allow:
      catalog: <your_catalog_name>
      types: <your_object_type>


      allow:
        <your_table_name>:
          allow: ["your_column_name"]
          condtions: "your_condition"

        <your_table_name>:  
          allow: ["your_column_name"]
          conditions: "your_condition"

        <your_table_name>:
    ```
For a detailed explanation of configuration parameters in the filter file, read: [Filter Reference]({{< ref "/docs/references/filter-reference" >}} "Filter Reference")

## VI. Set up Extractor Configuration

For real-time replication, you must create a heartbeat table in the source MySQL

1. Create a heartbeat table in the catalog/schema you are going to replicate with the following DDL:
   
    ```SQL
    CREATE TABLE `<user_database>`.`replicate_io_cdc_heartbeat`(
      timestamp BIGINT NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY(timestamp));
    ```
    Replace `<user_database>` with the name of your specific database.

2. Grant ```INSERT```, ```UPDATE```, and ```DELETE``` privileges for the heartbeat table to the user configured for replication

3. From ```$REPLICANT_HOME```, navigate to the extractor configuration file
   ```BASH
   vi conf/src/mysql.yaml
   ```
4. Under the Realtime Section, make the necessary changes as follows:
    ```YAML
    realtime:
      heartbeat:
        enable: true
        catalog: tpch #Replace tpch with the name of the database containing your heartbeat table
        table-name: replicate_io_cdc_heartbeat #Replace replicate_io_cdc_heartbeat with your heartbeat table's name if applicable
        column-name: timestamp #Replace timestamp with your heartbeat table's column name if applicable
    ```
5. Below is a sample extractor file with commonly used configuration parameters:
    ```YAML
    snapshot:
      threads: 16
      fetch-size-rows: 15_000

    #  per-table-config:
    #  - catalog: tpch
    #    tables:
    #      ORDERS:
    #        num-jobs: 1
    #      LINEITEM:
    #        row-identifier-key: [L_ORDERKEY]
    #        split-key: l_orderkey

    realtime:
      threads: 4
      fetch-size-rows: 10_000

      heartbeat:
        enable: true
        catalog: tpch
        interval-ms: 10000
    ```

## Replication of generated columns
Replicant supports replication of generated columns from MySQL to either a different database platform, or another MySQL database.

Replication of generated columns is supported for the following Replicant modes:

- [`snapshot`]({{< ref "docs/running-replicant#replicant-snapshot-mode" >}})
- [`realtime`]({{< ref "docs/running-replicant#replicant-realtime-mode" >}})
- [`full`]({{< ref "docs/running-replicant#replicant-full-mode" >}})
- [`fetch-schemas`]({{< ref "docs/running-replicant#fetch-schemas" >}})
- [`infer-schemas`]({{< ref "docs/running-replicant#infer-schemas" >}})

The behavior of replicating generated columns depends on the type of replication pipeline and your usage of the configuration parameters. See the following sections for more information.

### Configuration parameters
Use the following [Extractor configuration parameters](#extractor-parameters) and [CLI option](#cli-option) to control replication of generated columns.

{{< hint "warning" >}}
**Warning:**  If you specify [`create-sql`](#cli-option) or `fetch-create-sql`, only use schema name or database name in [Mapper file]({{< ref "docs/references/mapper-reference" >}}). Any Mapper rule with column names, table names, or others raises Exception.
{{< /hint >}}


#### Extractor parameters
You can specify these parameters in the Extractor configuration file of MySQL.

<dl class="dl-indent">
<dt>

`computed-columns`</dt>
<dd>
Whether to block or unblock replication of generated columns. It can take one of the following two values:

- `BLOCK`
- `UNBLOCK`

The behavior of `BLOCK` and `UNBLOCK` depends on the type of replication pipeline and how you use the [`create-sql`](#cli-option) or `fetch-create-sql` parameters.

</dd>

<dt>

`fetch-create-sql`</dt>
<dd>
This is a boolean parameter supporting the following two values:

- **`true`**. Replicant replicates the generated columns to the target without skipping data types and functions. This means that the tables possess the same definitions as the source.
- **`false`**. Replicant replicates generated columns with the following characteristics:

    - Replicant only replicates the data type and the data.
    - Replicant skips replicating functions. The target database table possesses different definition than the one on the source. Replicant treats generated columns as ordinary columns.

{{< hint "warning" >}}
**Warning:** Replicant doesn't support `fetch-create-sql` for [heterogeneous pipelines](#replication-of-generated-columns-in-heterogeneous-pipeline). Any usage of `fetch-create-sql` in a heterogeneous pipeline raises Exception.
{{< /hint >}}

</dd>

The following is a sample Extractor configuration for a [homogeneous pipeline](#replication-of-generated-columns-in-homogeneous-pipeline):

```YAML
snapshot:  
  threads: 16
  fetch-size-rows: 15_000
  min-job-size-rows: 1_000_000  
  max-jobs-per-chunk: 32
  computed-columns: UNBLOCK 
  fetch-user-roles: true
  fetch-create-sql : true
```

The preceeding sample instructs Replicant to replicate generated columns with data, corresponding data types, and functions.

#### CLI option
Replicant self-hosted CLI exposes a CLI option `create-sql`. `create-sql` yields the same outcome as setting `fetch-create-sql` to `true`.

`create-sql` holds a higher precedence than the Extractor parameter `fetch-create-sql`. If you run Replicant with the `create-sql` option, Replicant ignores the value of `fetch-create-sql`.

The following is a sample command for running Replicant:

```sh
./bin/replicant full conf/conn/mysql_src.yaml conf/conn/mysql_dst.yaml \
--filter filter/mysql_filter.yaml \
--extractor conf/src/mysql.yaml \
--metadata conf/metadata/postgresql.yaml \
--replace-existing --id mf2 \
--overwrite --create-sql
```

The preceeding command instructs Replicant to replicate the generated columns with data, the corresponding data types, and functions.

{{< hint "warning" >}}
**Warning:** Replicant doesn't support `create-sql` for [heterogeneous pipelines](#replication-of-generated-columns-in-heterogeneous-pipeline). Any usage of `create-sql` in a heterogeneous pipeline raises Exception.
{{< /hint >}}

### Replication of generated columns in heterogeneous pipeline
A heterogeneous pipeline means replication from MySQL to another database platform.

For a heterogeneous pipeline, set the `computed-columns` property to one of the following values in your Extractor configuration file:

#### `BLOCK`
Replicant skips replicating generated columns. No generated columns from your source MySQL exists in the target database you're replicating to.

#### `UNBLOCK`
Replicant replicates generated columns from source MySQL with the following caveats:

- Replicant only replicates the data type and the data.
- Replicant skips replicating functions. The target database table possesses different definition than the one on the source. Replicant treats generated columns as ordinary columns.

### Replication of generated columns in homogeneous pipeline
A homogeneous pipeline means replication between two identical database platforms. For example, a MySQL-to-MySQL replication pipeline.

For a homogeneous pipeline, the behavior of `computed-columns` is the following. The behavior depends on the usage of the [`create-sql`](#cli-option) or `fetch-create-sql` parameters:

<dl class="dl-indent" >
<dt>

With `fetch-create-sql` or `create-sql` enabled
</dt>
<dd>

If you set `fetch-create-sql` to `true` or specify [the `create-sql` CLI option](#cli-option), Replicant replicates data and corresponding data types as well as the functions. This means that table definition on the target stays the same as source. The value of `computed-columns` holds no effect in this scenario.
</dd>

<dt>

With `fetch-create-sql` or `create-sql` disabled</dt>
<dd>

If you set `fetch-create-sql` to `false` or omit [the `create-sql` CLI option](#cli-option), the behavior is the same as for a [heterogeneous pipeline](#replication-of-generated-columns-in-heterogeneous-pipeline).
