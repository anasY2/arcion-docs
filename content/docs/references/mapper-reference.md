# Mapper Configuration

While replicating data between storages of different type, Replicant by default attempts to transfer the data as fetched from the source while maintaining its structure. But there maybe situations where you need more control over Source data mapping. That's where a Mapper file comes in.

By using the Mapper file, you can precisely define how the data retrieved from the Source is applied to the Target/Destination. 

You can specify the Mapper file when running Replicant in the folliwng way :

```sh
./bin/replicant snapshot conf/conn/oracle.yaml \
conf/conn/singlestore.yaml \
--map sqlserver_to_singlestore_map.yaml
```

## Overview
The Mapper file contains a map of rules where each rule applies to a single Target catalog or schema (namespace). 

- For databases that support both catalog and schema, each rule applies to a single schema. The schema must be prefixed with the catalog (fully qualified). 
- For each Target namespace, it's possible to define a list of Source namespaces, the contents of which will then be mapped into the Target namespace.

When you need more control, you can define additional rules for the tables and columns. Table rules are defined in the similar fashion as namespace rulesâ€”using the tables map. In the tables map, you can specify multiple source tables for each destination tables. 

{{< hint "info" >}} **Note:** Target tables are defined using only their name, while Source table names need to be fully qualified with each table's respective catalog and schema. {{< /hint >}}

For each table mapping, it's also possible to map columns based on their names.

## Structure of Mapper Rules

Following is a template of the structure of Mapper rules:

```YAML
rules:
  [<target_namespace>]:
    source:
    - [<source_namespace>]:
      .
      .
      .  

    tables:
      <target_table_name>:
        source:
        - [<src_namespace>, <src_table_name>]:
             <target_col_name>: <src_col_name>
             .
             .
             .
           .
           .
           .
         .
         .
         .
    .
    .
    .
```

### Example

Below is a sample Mapper file for a **SQL Server-to-SingleStore** pipeline:

```YAML
rules:
  [testdb_s]:
    source:
    - [testdb, dbo]:
    tables:
      testTB1_s:
        source:
          [testdb, dbo, TestTB1]:
            col1_s: col1
```

In the above example:

- `testdb_s` is the Target database name that you want to change to.
- Under `source` parameter, the flow sequence containing `testdb` and `dbo` represents Source database name and schema name (SQL Server default schema name is `dbo`) respectively.
- `testTB1_s` is the name of the table at Target that you want to change to.
- The flow sequence `[testdb, dbo, TestTB1]` under `source` represents the Source database name, Source schema name, and Source table name respectively. Pay attention to case sensitivity.
- The key-value pair `col1_s: col1` maps Target column name to Source column name

You can also find sample Mapper files for different pipelines in the `mapper` directory of your [Arcion Self-hosted download](/docs/quickstart/#ii-download-replicant-and-create-a-home-repository).

## Dynamic trimming options

There maybe cases where the Target database does not support the name length of tables in the Source database. In those cases, you can make use of the following options inside a mapper file to enable trimming of table and column names:

  1. `dynamic-identifier-name-trimming`*[v20.12.04.5]*: `true` of `false`. When set to `true`, table/column names are trimmed so that it fits the length Target supports.
  2. `identifier-mapping-table-namespace`*[v20.12.04.5]*: Represents the namespace where the mappings of table/column are stored in Target database.
    - `catalog`: Specify catalog name if applicable.
    - `schema`: Specify schema name if applicable.
